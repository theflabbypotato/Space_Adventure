# **Space Adventure**

Evan Zhang

Space Adventure is a Space-Themed Game where the player wanders around exploring a spaceship. The goal is to ultimately figure out how to entire the cockpit and move the spaceship to a mysterious green portal.

I made this game to learn about VR/AR development in Unity.  I watched tutorials by Valem Tutorials on Youtube which was super helpful.
